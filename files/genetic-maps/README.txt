average_CEU_YRI_ASN:
interpolated map positions from the genetic map generated by the HapMap 2 Project, which is an average over recombination rates in the CEU, YRI, and ASN populations. This map was lifted over to hg19 by Adam Auton and is available at ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/technical/working/20110106_recombination_hotspots/
